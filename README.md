# Manage GetResponse newsletters in Laravel 5

Fork of the awesome [![spatie/laravel-newsletter](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-newsletter)]
"Beter goed gejat dan slecht verzonnen" :) 


This package provides an easy way to integrate GetResponse with Laravel 5. Behind the scenes [??v3] for the GetResponse API is used. Here are some examples of what you can do with the package:

```php
Newsletter::subscribe('rincewind@discworld.com');

Newsletter::unsubscribe('the.luggage@discworld.com');

//Merge variables can be passed as the second argument
Newsletter::subscribe('sam.vines@discworld.com', ['firstName'=>'Sam', 'lastName'=>'Vines']);

//Subscribe someone to a specific list by using the third argument:
Newsletter::subscribe('nanny.ogg@discworld.com', ['firstName'=>'Nanny', 'lastName'=>'Ogg'], 'Name of your list');

//Get some member info, returns an array described in the official docs
Newsletter::getMember('lord.vetinari@discworld.com');

//Returns a boolean
Newsletter::hasMember('greebo@discworld.com');

//If you want to do something else, you can get an instance of the underlying API:
Newsletter::getApi();
```


## Installation

You can install this package via Composer using:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-newsletter
```

You must also install this service provider.

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\Newsletter\NewsletterServiceProvider::class,
    ...
];
```

If you want to make use of the facade you must install it as well.

```php
// config/app.php
'aliases' => [
    ..
    'Newsletter' => Spatie\Newsletter\NewsletterFacade::class,
];
```

To publish the config file to `app/config/laravel-newsletter.php` run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Newsletter\NewsletterServiceProvider"
```

This wil publish a file `laravel-newsletter.php` in your config directory with the following contents: 
```php
return [

        /*
         * The api key of a MailChimp account. You can find yours here:
         * https://us10.admin.mailchimp.com/account/api-key-popup/
         */
        'apiKey' => env('MAILCHIMP_APIKEY'),

        /*
         * When not specifying a listname in the various methods,
         *  this list name will be used.
         */
        'defaultListName' => 'subscribers',

        /*
         * Here you can define properties of the lists you want to
         * send campaigns.
         */
        'lists' => [

            /*
             * This key is used to identify this list. It can be used
             * in the various methods provided by this package.
             *
             * You can set it to any string you want and you can add
             * as many lists as you want.
             */
            'subscribers' => [

                /*
                 * A mail chimp list id. Check the mailchimp docs if you don't know
                 * how to get this value:
                 * http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/find-your-list-id
                 */
                 'id' => env('MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID'),
            ],
        ],
];
```

## Usage

After you've installed the package and filled in the values in the config-file working with this package will be a breeze. All the following examples use the facade. Don't forget to import it at the top of your file.

```php
use Newsletter;
```

### Subscribing and unsubscribing

Subscribing an email address can be done like this:

```php
use Newsletter;

Newsletter::subscribe('rincewind@discworld.com');
```

Let's unsubcribe someone:

```php
Newsletter::unsubscribe('the.luggage@discworld.com');
```

You can pass some merge variables as the second argument:
```php
Newsletter::subscribe('rincewind@discworld.com', ['firstName'=>'Rince', 'lastName'=>'Wind']);
```
Please note the at the time of this writing the default merge variables in MailChimp are named `FNAME` and `LNAME`. In our examples we use `firstName` and `lastName` for extra readability.

You can subscribe someone to a specific list by using the third argument:
```php
Newsletter::subscribe('rincewind@discworld.com', ['firstName'=>'Rince', 'lastName'=>'Wind'], 'subscribers');
```
That third argument is the name of a list you configured in the config file.

You can also unsubscribe someone from a specific list:
```php
Newsletter::unsubscribe('rincewind@discworld.com', 'subscribers');
```

### Getting subscriber info

You can get information on a subscriber by using the `getMember`-function:
```php
Newsletter::getMember('lord.vetinari@discworld.com');
```

This will return an array with information on the subscriber. If there's no one subscribed with that
e-mailaddress the function will return `false`

There's also a convience method to check if some in subscribed:

```php
Newsletter::hasMember('nanny.ogg@discworld.com'); //returns a bool
```

### Creating a campaign

This is how you create a campaign:
```php
/**
 * @param string $fromName
 * @param string $replyTo
 * @param string $subject
 * @param string $html
 * @param string $listName
 * @param array  $options
 * @param array  $contentOptions
 *
 * @return array|bool
 *
 * @throws \Spatie\Newsletter\Exceptions\InvalidNewsletterList
 */
public function createCampaign($fromName, $replyTo, $subject, $html = '', $listName = '', $options = [], $contentOptions = [])
```

Note the campaign will only be created, no mails will be sent out.

### Handling errors

If something went wrong you can get the last error with
```php
Newsletter::getLastError();
```

If you just want to make sure if the last action succeeded you can to this:
```php
Newsletter::lastActionSucceeded();
```

### Need something else?

If you need more functionality you get an instance of the underlying [GetResponse Api](https://github.com/GetResponse/getresponse-api-php) with:

```php
$api = Newsletter::getApi();
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
